# ESP8266-Alarm-server
The ESP8266 Alarm Server is a code designed for Hisilicon and Hisillicon-based NVR devices, such as those from Smonet, that use port 15002 as their alarm server port. The code captures alarm server messages in JSON format and forwards them to an MQTT broker through the Wi-Fi protocol.
